# animate-in
Animate In - a super lightweight, responsive friendly JS/CSS plugin to animate in elements on scroll. 

### Notes About Plug-in
This plug-in only animates elements in that are not already in view. As the user scrolls, when the element is within the viewport range, additional animate-in classes are added to handle the animation styles. JavaScript handles delays for additional elements on the screen.

### Requirements:
- jQuery 1.8.+

### How to Use
- Add class "animate-in" to any html element. 
- Add additional classes to set animation direction. Examples "animate-from-left", "animate-from-right", "animate-pop-in". Default style is fade in when no additional classes are added.
